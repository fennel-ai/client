# Installation

## 1. Install the client library

```bash
pip install fennel-ai
```

To find the version of the installed library

```bash
pip show fennel-ai
```

_To try out the abstraction without a real cluster checkout using a mock client under_ [_Unit Tests_](/testing/unit-tests)



## 2. Provision a cluster

Currently, the self-serve option to create a cluster doesn't exist. Instead, ask your contact at Fennel to create a dedicated cluster for you and give you its URL. Also, see [deployment model](/overview/deployment-model) to learn more about how Fennel cluster can be provisioned inside your VPC.
