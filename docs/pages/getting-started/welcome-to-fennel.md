# Welcome to Fennel

Fennel is a modern realtime feature engineering platform inspired by the ethos
of PyTorch and is architected in service of the following four design goals:

## Fennel's Four Design Goals
1. **Easy to install, learn & use** - be approachable to data 
   science / ML teams and to make them fully self-dependent for end
   to end feature engineering workflows.
2. **Maintain data/feature quality via best practices** - production ML systems
   often get plagued by data/feature quality issues. Prevention & detection 
   of such issues (via best practices & tooling) is a cornerstone of Fennel's 
   architecture, not an afterthought. (Read [more](/data-quality/approach))
3. **Work equally well for batch & realtime** - ML is transitioning from being
   predominantly batch oriented today to being more realtime. Fennel is built 
   in a way that the exact same code works equally well for any combination of batch, 
   streaming, & realtime computation.
4. **Keep cloud costs low** - feature engineering often requires dealing with large
   volumes of data and gets very costly. For any workload, Fennel aims
   to be at least as cost-effective as a hand-rolled system while also being 
   more powerful & easier to use. (Read [more](/architecture/cost-optimizations))

## Use Cases

Fennel is a general purpose feature platform and is useful for a variety of use 
cases. Here are some of the most common ones:
- **Fraud Detection** - relevant for fintech or anywhere money exchange is involved
- **Risk Engineering** - identifying fake users, spam, bot rings and lot more
- **Credit Underwriting** - use cases dealing with credit risk like credit cards, 
  buy-now-pay-later, loan underwriting etc. 
- **Insurance Underwriting** - assessing the probability of filing a claim, expected
  damages etc.
- **Recommendations / Personalization** - relevant for most marketplaces, e-commerce products, 
  content feeds, notifications, email marketing campaigns etc. 
- **Search Ranking** - ordering available documents in response to a query
  based on relevance, personalization, or custom preferences

.. and lot more!

## Getting Started With Fennel

[Start](/getting-started/quickstart) here if you want to directly dive deep into
 an end-to-end example.&#x20;

Or if you are not in a hurry, read about the main [concepts](/getting-started/concepts) 
first followed by some more details about Fennel's [architecture](/architecture/overview).

We, the team behind Fennel, have thoroughly enjoyed building Fennel and hope 
learning and using Fennel brings as much delight to you as well!
