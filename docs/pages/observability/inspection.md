# Inspecting Fennel Data

Sometimes it's valuable to understand and inspect the data as it flows through 
Fennel, so as to be able to see the transformations your datasets have experienced.

Fennel console makes this easy by letting you:
1. Inspect random recent updates to any dataset

2. Lookup arbitrary rows with the key for keyed datasets

Both of these actions can also be done via Fennel's REST APIs.
