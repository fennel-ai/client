# Privacy & Security

### General InfoSec

Fennel runs inside your VPC and thus is subject to your usual infosec policies. The customer data never leaves your cloud which eliminates many privacy/compliance vulnurabilities.

### Data security

Fennel uses industry best-practices for data security:

* All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
* Secure strorage of user-provided secrets in secrete stores
* All inter-server communication happens over TLS
* Authentication and TLS for client-server requests

### Privacy

For GDPR compliance, Fennel allows stored data to be physically deleted.
